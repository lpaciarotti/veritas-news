        Donald Trump has delivered a speech in front of cheering supporters at the White House in his first public appearance since being hospitalised.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The event was officially a "peaceful protest", but looked, critics said, much like a Trump campaign rally.
    </p>
    <p>
        The president, who says he is no longer taking medicines against Covid-19, told the crowd he was "feeling great".
    </p>
    <p>
        The White House has not provided an update on the president's health since Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is unclear whether the president remains contagious following his three-day hospital stay with Covid-19.
    </p>
    <p>
        Joe Biden's campaign said the Democratic candidate had tested negative for the coronavirus on Saturday, ahead of a planned campaign trip to Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
        Polling suggests Mr Biden has a single-digit lead over Mr Trump and an ABC News/Ipsos poll found that just 35% of Americans approved of how Mr Trump has handled the coronavirus crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
        More than 210,000 Americans are known to have died of Covid-19.

    <h2>
        What did Mr Trump say at the White House event?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Saturday's White House gathering was partly organised by a foundation called "Blexit", which aims to get black and Latino voters to support the Republican party. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        The president, who was not wearing a mask, railed against Mr Biden, describing the Democrat's programme as "beyond socialism - Communist, that's about right". Mr Biden is generally considered to be a moderate Democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr Trump repeated his previous assertion that he had done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln - a claim the BBC has previously fact-checked.
    </p>

    <p>
        While Mr Biden appears ahead in national polling, US presidential elections are in practice determined in key states where both candidates stand a chance of winning, rather than by the total number of votes won - as Hillary Clinton found to her cost in 2016.
    </p>
    <p>
        The president's campaign team says he is planning to attend a "big rally" in Florida - a battleground state in next month's presidential election - on Monday, followed by trips to Pennsylvania and Iowa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr Biden expressed disbelief at the president's plans to hold rallies and criticised the Trump administration's lax stance on mask use as reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I wouldn't show up unless you have a mask and can distance," Mr Biden said, speaking while campaigning in Las Vegas on Friday.   
    </p>
    <h2>
        What is the latest on the president's health?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mr Trump told Fox News that he was feeling "really, really strong" and was no longer on medication, having had his "final doses of just about everything".
    </p>
    <p>
        On Thursday the president's doctor Sean Conley said that it would be safe for him to return to public engagements on Saturday [10 October] as that would mark "day 10" since his diagnosis on Thursday 1 October.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following his diagnosis, Mr Trump spent three nights in hospital and was treated with the steroid dexamethasone, the antiviral drug remdesivir and a cocktail of manufactured antibodies made by the company Regeneron.

    <p>
        The CDC recommends self-isolation for at least 10 days after coronavirus symptoms first appear, with more severe illness, such as that requiring hospital treatment, potentially needing up to 20 days.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What about the debates?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Next week's second presidential debate between Mr Trump and Mr Biden has been officially cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Commission on Presidential Debates said in a statement on Friday that both campaigns had announced "alternate plans for that date".
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr Trump had baulked at a request from the commission to hold the 15 October showdown virtually to minimise the risk of spreading coronavirus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The commission, which is a non-partisan body in charge of organising the general election debates, said it was still making arrangements for the third and final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, on 22 October.
    </p> 
    <img src="images/biden-campaing.jpg"        alt="biden-campaing">
    <p>
        The Trump campaign said the commission was "biased" towards Mr Biden, while the Democrat's team accused the president of ducking the debate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, on Friday announced legislation to establish a commission to assess a president's fitness for office.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs Pelosi said it was not meant to rule on Mr Trump's condition. In any case, any serious consideration of the measure before the election is unlikely.
